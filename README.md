The all_data.csv file contains the dataset collected by the entire team during two trips.
The Aqueous Data - Summary of Alkalinity_DIC.csv file includes data from 25 samples collected during the first trip, where Alkalinity and DIC were measured.
The Aqueous Data - 2nd Alkalinity and DIC.csv file contains data from 25 samples collected during the second trip, also with Alkalinity and DIC measurements.
Using all these datasets, I compiled a data analysis. The analysis is documented in two files: main-1.ipynb and main-2.ipynb.
